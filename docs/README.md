Pillarbox is the modern SRG SSR multimedia player ecosystem, built on top of [AndroiX Media3](https://developer.android.com/media/media3). Pillarbox has been designed with robustness, flexibility, and  efficiency in mind, with full customization of:
- Metadata and asset URL retrieval.
- Asset resource loading, including support for Widevine and PlayReady.
- Analytics integration.
- User interface layout, in either [Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layouts) or [XML `View`s](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/declaring-layout). Helpers are available in the `pillarbox-ui` module.

Its robust player provides all essential playback features you might expect:
- Audio and video (including 360Â° videos) playback.
- Support for on-demand and live streams, with and without DVR.
- Integration with the system playback user experience.
- Integration with Android's `MediaSession` and Android Auto.
- Playlist management (navigation to previous/next item, shuffle, repeat, ...).
- Support for alternative audio tracks, audio description, subtitles, ...
- Multiple instances support.
- Picture-in-picture support.
- Playback speed controls.

In addition, Pillarbox provides support for SRG SSR content by including the `pillarbox-core-business` module (see "Getting started" below).

> [!TIP]
> Pillarbox is also available on [Apple platforms](https://github.com/SRGSSR/pillarbox-apple/) and the [Web](https://github.com/SRGSSR/pillarbox-web/).

## Demo

You can easily get your hands on Pillarbox, by running one of the demo applications available in this project: [pillarbox-demo](../pillarbox-demo) for phone/tablet, or [pillarbox-demo-tv](../pillarbox-demo-tv) for TV.

Each application allows you to:
- Try Pillarbox with various media types and sources.
- See how Pillarbox answers various use cases (`pillarbox-demo` only).
- Access a wide range of SRG SSR content.
- Search for a specific SRG SSR content.

## Getting started

### Add the GitHub Packages repository

Pillarbox is deployed to [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/SRGSSR/packages?repo_name=pillarbox-android). So you need to add the following repository in your Gradle configuration:

```kotlin
// If you declare your repositories in the `settings.gradle(.kts)` file
repositories {
    maven("https://maven.pkg.github.com/SRGSSR/pillarbox-android") {
        credentials {
            username = providers.gradleProperty("gpr.user").get()
            password = providers.gradleProperty("gpr.key").get()
        }
    }
}

// If you declare your repositories in the root `build.gradle(.kts)` file
repositories {
    maven("https://maven.pkg.github.com/SRGSSR/pillarbox-android") {
        credentials {
            username = project.findProperty("gpr.user")?.toString()
            password = project.findProperty("gpr.key")?.toString()
        }
    }
}
```

#### Create a Personal access token

1. Go to [Settings > Developer Settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
2. Click on `Generate new token`.
3. Provide a note for the token, and change the expiration (if needed).
4. Make sure that at least the `read:packages` scope is selected.
5. Click on `Generate token`.
6. Copy your Personal access token.
7. In your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file (create it if needed), add the following properties:
```properties
gpr.user=<your_GitHub_username>
gpr.key=<your_GitHub_personal_access_token>
```

> [!TIP]
> You can check the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-gradle-registry#using-a-published-package) for more information.

### Add the Pillarbox dependencies

In your module's `build.gradle`/`build.gradle.kts` file, add the following dependencies, based on your needs:

```kotlin
// Player specific features
implementation("ch.srgssr.pillarbox:pillarbox-player:<pillarbox_version>")

// Library to handle SRG SSR content through media URNs
implementation("ch.srgssr.pillarbox:pillarbox-core-business:<pillarbox_version>")

// Library to display the video surface
implementation("ch.srgssr.pillarbox:pillarbox-ui:<pillarbox_version>") 
```

The latest stable version is [![Last release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/SRGSSR/pillarbox-android?label=)](https://github.com/SRGSSR/pillarbox-android/releases/latest)

### Enable Java 17

If not already enabled, you also need to turn on Java 17 support in every `build.gradle`/`build.gradle.kts` files using Pillarbox. To do so, add/update the following to/in the `android` section:

```kotlin
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
}

kotlinOptions {
    jvmTarget = "17"
}
```

### Support Android API < 24

A change in AndroidX Media3 1.3.0 requires applications to use library desugaring, as described in the corresponding [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring):

```kotlin
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true
}

dependencies {
    coreLibraryDesugaring("com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.0.4")
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This should be done even if your min SDK version is 24+.

### Integrate Pillarbox
