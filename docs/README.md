## Warning

The Pillarbox project is still under heavy development, any implementation, information or documentation found on this repository may change at 
anytime.

## About

Pillarbox is the modern SRG SSR player ecosystem. It is build on top of [Exoplayer](https://exoplayer.dev/). So if you know how to work with
_Exoplayer_, then you know how to work with _Pillarbox_.

It relies heavily on the version of [Media3](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/media3) that integrates Exoplayer to the Android
Media framework.

## Compatibility

The library is suitable for applications running on android SDK 21 and above. The project is meant to be compiled with the latest Android version.

## Integration

To use the library inside your project, you need to access Github packages, you need to create a _Personal access tokens_ and use it as credential.

### Add maven repository to you repositories

```gradle
maven {
    url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/SRGSSR/pillarbox-android")
    credentials {
         username = GITHUB_USER
         password = GITHUB_TOKEN // with read:packages access!
         }
    }
```

Do not set those credentials inside your repository!

### Add Pillarbox module dependencies

```gradle
implementation("ch.srgssr.pillarbox:pillarbox-player:$LATEST_RELEASE_VERSION")
// Library to handle SRG content through media urns
implementation("ch.srgssr.pillarbox:pillarbox-core-business:$LATEST_RELEASE_VERSION")
```
